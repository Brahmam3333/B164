Variance (sd^2) and var test (F-test) result:
Male variance:  355440125 
Female variance:  349572321 

	F test to compare two variances

data:  male_prices and female_prices
F = 1.0168, num df = 4949, denom df = 4917, p-value = 0.5589
alternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances is not equal to 1

Effect size (Cohen's d) approximation:
Cohen's d (pooled sd):  -0.0059 

Decision: p-value >= 0.05 => do not reject H0. No strong evidence of difference in mean sale price between genders.
